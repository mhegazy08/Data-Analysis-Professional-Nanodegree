# Data-Analysis-Professional-Nanodegree
## Introduction
This repository contains the projects I worked on in the **Udacity Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree**. The projects includes:
- Python Project
- Data Analysis Project
  
  ### Python Project
  In this project I used of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
  Files Needed to run the project:
  - chicago.csv
  - new_york_city.csv
  - washington.csv
  - bikeshare.py

  A txt file named **_download links_** contain links to download the csv files. These files need to be all in the same directory.
  
  ### Data Analysis Project
  In this project I performed a complete data analysis process to answer the question: Why do patients miss their scheduled appointments? I used python including libraries of NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib in order to perform the analysis.
Files Needed to run the project:
  - noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv
  - Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb
